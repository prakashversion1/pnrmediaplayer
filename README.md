pnrmediaplayer
==============

This is a simple media player which was a programming practice in our minor project

This was a combined project of me myself prakash Joshi , Raman Amatya and Nischal Pradhan.

PNR mediaplayer is capable of playing audiofiles, video files,a playlist,a format converter and has a RTP for transmitting files in realtime.

The realtime file transfer should not be working very well. There is some work left to do on that side of the code.

Also some work might be required to make it indepedent form the java media framework. So currently it requires the java media
framework to run.
